# s3_notes
S3 Notes is a web application that lets you read and write a text file (your "notes") from any browser.

The main features are
  1. Your notes are stored on S3
  2. The application itself is static Javascript that can be run in-browser, so it can also be served from S3

It typically costs me 5-15 cents a month to run this app.
